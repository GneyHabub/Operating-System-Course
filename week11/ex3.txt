First programm will print "Hello" twice, and the first one will do it only once.
It happens because \n character in secund programm flushes the buffer before second proccess inherits data from the first one.
In first program we do not have this character, so the unflushed buffer is passed to the child proccess^ that's why "Hello" is printed twice.
